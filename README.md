MotdSnark
==========

MotdSnark is a Spigot Minecraft Server plugin for 1.14 and 1.15 (and hopefully 1.16 soon)

MotdSnark replaces the server's MOTD, (which appears in the server select page in minecraft) with a random item from a list in the config.

The config will be auto-created the first time you boot the server with the mods, and can be found in `plugins/MotdSnark`.
The list of MOTDs will only be loaded at server boot when you modify it.


MotdSnark is part of my collection of mods with the following goals:
- Performant, Native-feeling
- Simple and easy to maintain
- Provide 1 feature effectively
